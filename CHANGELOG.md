## V0.12.0

    - Introduction of pre-commit hooks (Ruff & Blacks)
    - Linting of code
    - Creation of feature selection mode for AO
    - max_features kwarg added for feature selection
    - moved source code into an src folder & modified dockerfile
    - created utils subfolder
    - created models subfolder
    - added in structure.md within ./src to explain the structure format adopted
    - renamed mode scripts to have a `mode_` pre-fix
    - added extra assertion in mode checks
    - removed redundant `check_config`, `check_keys`, `load_params_json`, `activate`
    - refactored `plot_graphs` to remove unnessicary `plot_dict` var
    - extracted load funcs from utils into own file
    - extracted save funcs from utils into own file
    - extracted util funcs from `mode_plotting` into respective files
    - extracted plotting funcs from `mode_plotting` into own files
    - removed exit() calls
    - bugfixes
    - extracted save funcs from models into utils.save
    - extracted load funcs from data_processing into utils.load
    - streamlined init
    - removed globals() call
    - extracted funcs from data_processing into appropriate locations, and file fully dispersed
    - changed call of parsing FS entry to correct place
    - separated problem specific plots into own files
    - extracted shap and permutation importance plots into their own subfolders given their importance
    - consolidate metric functions into one location
    - consolidate model defs into one location
    - custom model clean up
    - shifted repeated save_model code from TabAuto children into TabAuto
    - shifted repeated load_model code from TabAuto children into TabAuto, except for FixedKeras & AutoKeras being keras based they load in a different was so have left their re-implementation of load model
    - shifted repeated fit code from TabAuto children into TabAuto
    - shifted repeated init code from TabAuto children into TabAuto
    - generalised repeated _define_model code and shifted from TabAuto children into TabAuto
    - removed repeated set_params from TabAuto
    - removed unnessicary data being passed to plot_reg, plot_clf, perm_imp and most of plot_both functions
    - removed unnessicary data being passed to plots_shap functions and separated out problem specific logic into separate function.
    - extract repeated getting model_path code to function
    - streamlined custom model setup
    - TabAuto Class merged with CustomModel Class
    - Deleted autogulon src code, as was depreciated ages ago
    - Custom SKLearnModel code only ever instansiated in auto mode for AutoSklearn so removed redundant code
    - added test coverage config
    - tests, type hinting and docstring created for:
        - metrics.define_scorers
        - utils.ml.class_balancing
        - utils.ml.data_split.std_split & strat_split
        - plotting.plot_utils
    - reduce ussage of full config dict in:
        - R_replacement.py
    - added probabilities for predictions when doing classification problems
    - code comment clean up
    - multiline strings causing extra space fixed
    - added pytest marks to distinguish binary classiification problems
    - microbiome pre-processing bugfix
    - lgbm warning re: suggest_loguniform & suggest_uniform resolved
